# classesAndobjects
Using OOP, we are able to model the real world. Assuming we are working in a delivery company, and we are to program a delivery drone, up to this point we have learnt that we can probably do that with basic functions and conditional logic. 
But the problem is that as the code gets bigger and bigger, it will not just be one file or rather a few lines of code, but thousands or even million lines of code divided into different files. Thus the code gets more and more complicated.
With the introduction of OOP, using the `class` keyword, we were able to model objects that represent the real world and even methods/actions on these objects. We were also able to organize our objects/models into different groups.
The class is the blueprint of what we wanna create; the basic attributes, properties and methods/actions our class can take. From the blueprint(class) we are able to create different objects using the class as the building block.
